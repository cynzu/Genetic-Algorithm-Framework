<h2>Genetic Algorithm Framework</h2> 
<p>
The zujkomiller.genetic package and its subpackages contain a framework of classes written in java for performing genetic algorithms.  
</p>
<p>
A genetic algorithm mimics the process of biological evolution in order to find a solution to a problem.  In nature, the "problem" is survival, and the "solution" is to create individuals with traits which enable them to survive and reproduce, thereby passing on the genes which make them fit. In nature, chromosomes of DNA molecules carry the genes which become expressed as traits.  In a computer program the "problem" can be anything, and the program designer can choose what it means for a solution to be "good" or "fit".

As in nature, a genetic algorithm deals with chromosomes.  These are usually strings of characters, or "genes".  In DNA, they are A, T, C, and G, but in a genetic algorithm they may be either binary (containing only ones and zeros), or more complex (containing more than two symbols in its alphabet of possible genes).  Just as in nature, a genetic algorithm will start with one "generation" or set of chromosomes each of which is generated randomly, each with a slightly different configuration.  Then, each individual in that generation is put through some test of fitness which the programmer devises.  The fitness test should reflect how well the solution (represented by the chromosome) solves the problem.  After each individual in a parent generation is tested for fitness, a child generation is created from the parent: the least fit members of the parent generation are thrown out; the most fit members are cloned and "mated" with one another; and a few random mutations are added to the mix. After many generations, better and better solutions to the problem emerge because the genes that make them good solutions are selected-for through this process of creating child generations from the most fit members of the parent generation.
