scoringRules=The solution receives its fitness score based on whether or not the end of the maze was reached. If the end of the maze was reached, then the score is determined by subtracting the actual number of moves from the number of possible moves. (The maximum number of moves possible is the maximum length of the chromosome, which was established in the parameters used to run the genetic algorithm.)  Then, the number of times a wall was hit is subracted.  A bonus is added for reaching the destination.  (The amount of the bonus is also established in the parameters used to run the genetic algorithm.) Finally, points are subtracted for any steps taken after the end of the maze was reached.  If the end of the maze was never reached, then the score is determined by how close to the destination the solution came.
